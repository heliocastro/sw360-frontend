# sw360-frontend
This is the heavily experimental frontend proof of concept for sw360 frontend replacement and continuos development

The main goal is achieve at least all pages in read only mode and one edit/addition

## If you dare to try...

* Install nodejs ( container, host, where you think is best for you )
* Create a .env file on root with at least this entry: ```VITE_SW360_API_URL="<your sw360 url>"```
* Do ```yarn install``` 
* Do ```yarn dev```

Your frontend will be running in port 3000

## Good luck but....

Please contact me anytime here that i appreciate any input and idea exchanges or even see a quick demo

**I'm not a web developer** ( Or at least i wasn't ) :-)
